SCOTTYS PYTHON BUDGET GUI

Idea: I am trying to make a budget application that tracks all of your expenses. It Will have a homepage that displays your 
current ammounts of money in your chequings and savings. It will also show your 5 next upcoming expenses and the dates they need to be payed.
it will also track how much money I have in my TFSA, which is used to track stocks and investementsts.

Features:

Add Expense Button ~ The add expense button will have an option to add a special expense or a reoccurring expense. a reoccuring 
expense can be "monthly" or "biweekly". you have the option to give the expense a name, date, next date, value, importance level, !!!, !! or !

you can press, add pay amount. this will determine your values for the next couple weeks.

if you have any debts, you can choose to pay that off with your values. 

values will be presented in percentage, in a "set values" button. This will have to end up in 100% or will display an error.
