                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>I am a first year software development student at CNA in my first semester. I have a bit of prevous knowledge from doing an online year of the EWD program.</p>

                    <h3>background</h3>
                    <p>I was born in Trinidad & Tobago as my mom's side of the family lives there. My parents decided it would be safer to raise me in Canada, as my father is a Newfoundlander born and bred, and he'll be here till he dies. We moved to Cape Breton for a few years for my fathers job. When we returned, I went to a different school and had to make all new friends. Growing up, I played the violin and played sports up until JR high (I wasn't very good).</p>

                    <h3>Academic History</h3>
                    <p>I graduated Highschool at Holy Heart of Mary with honors and I was accepted into the Engineering Program at Memorial University. I started the program in 2020 so it was in the heart of covid. As you can imagine, I didn't do too well in the program. I decided to drop out in november of my second year along with two of my friends. The three of us moved out to a ski resort to defer my education by a term. The term turned into almost 2 years until I decided to continue my education. Instead of going back to engineering, I applied to the SD program at CNA and I was placed on a waitlist. In the meantine, I also applied to the EWD program while I wait and got accepted. I was accepting into the SD program in march of 2023 and am currently finishing up my first term.</p>
